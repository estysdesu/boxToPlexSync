# boxToPlexSync

## Description
A Python program that merges the contents of a Box Sync folder online with a local folder. Box Sync does not have a Linux client. I wanted to sync the contents of a box folder containing media with a Plex Server running on a Raspberry Pi. The program requires ```cron``` to schedule the file to be run every hour or however often you want it to update.

This program is tested; however, not extensively and could not be deployed for my account because I do not have admin priveleges on my Box account (it is through my college).
